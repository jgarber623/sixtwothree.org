I’m happy to announce we’ve just relaunched the [Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) site. Designed by [Martin Ringlein](http://flickr.com/photos/mringlein) of [Maryland Media](http://www.marylandmedia.com/) and built by [myself](http://sixtwothree.org/), the new site is a reflection of the changing needs of the group as it has grown.

I’ve been absolutely overwhelmed by the consistently high turnout we’ve had at our monthly meetings and felt it was time to spruce up the site. Martin did an excellent job integrating photos from our [Flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/refresh-dc/) and incorporating more aspects of [the forum](http://refresh-dc.org/forum/).
