Or, more specifically, _web pages_ are cake. Here's why.

Think about a cake. Here's [a good one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/72685908@N00/3528819819), for example. Your standard birthday cake is made up of three key layers: the cake itself, the frosting, and the extra decorations (sprinkles/jimmies/shots/whatever, [frosted roses](http://www.flickr.com/photos/72685908@N00/192762759), etc.) on top.

A good cake incorporates these components in a particular proportion. The foundation of the cake (and the bulk of its volume) is the moist, spongy layer. Above that, a thick—but not _too thick_—helping of frosting (buttercream, whipped, lard-based… you name it). And finally, skillfully-applied decorations complete the cake.

Think of your web pages (websites, [web thangs](http://adactio.com/journal/6246/)) as cakes. A solid foundation of HTML coated with a layer of style and topped with a touch of JavaScript to bring the whole thing to life. The proportions for each aren't too disimilar either, right?

As you wouldn't build a cake atop its sprinkles or frosted roses, nor should you build your web pages on [a shaky layer of JavaScript](http://sighjavascript.tumblr.com/post/60259993974/instagram). A solid foundation of markup, a tasteful (and tasty) layer of style, and an appropriate application of JavaScript make for a well- and responsibly-built website.

Now who's for cake?
