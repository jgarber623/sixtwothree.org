title: The future of TV?

In “[The future of TV in ‘The Office’](http://news.com.com/2061-11199_3-6035774.html?part=rss&tag=6035774&subj=news),” Mike Yamamoto writes:

This is one thing I will never understand about network television. Both “The Office” and “My Name Is Earl” more or less had the run of things on their former home on Tuesday evenings. So what do the networks do with two successful shows? Put them up against every other network’s hottest shows on Thursday night. It’s almost as if television networks _don’t like broadcasting television programs_.

The article also expounds on how Tivo and other PVRs have made timeslots irrelevant. I couldn’t agree more. I hate to think of how much money I throw away on cable for channels I don’t watch, only to end up downloading the shows I missed because I _can’t remember when they come on_. The future of entertainment is in direct download. The sooner Big Entertainment realizes this, the better off we’ll all be.
