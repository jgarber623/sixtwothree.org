A new project at work has me diving deep into [Microformats](http://microformats.org/) and [XFN](http://gmpg.org/xfn/). I was looking to provide a link back from the page I was working on to that page’s inspiration and naturally found `rel="muse"` to be appropriate. Something was bothering me about its XFN classification though. In the [documentation](http://gmpg.org/xfn/11), `rel="muse"` is listed under as being a romantic relationship. This didn’t seem right.

I talked to [Kevin](http://lawver.net/) and [Cindy](http://cindyli.com/) about it and we all agreed that being one’s muse does not infer a romantic (in the sexual sense) relationship between two individuals. Wanting further validation, I sought out the maddeningly intelligent folks on the [microformats-discuss](http://microformats.org/discuss/) list.

Turns out `rel="muse"`’s classification as “romantic” is in the capital-R Romantic sense. There was a bit of discussion of classic Roman literature and The Muses and whatnot – most of it over this author’s head (I was never much of a literature person in school). Either way, there’s a [FAQ page](http://microformats.org/wiki/xfn-faq) available now on [the wiki](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) to answer questions like these. [My question](http://microformats.org/wiki/xfn-faq#Why_is_muse_in_the_romantic_category) is the first entry on the page. Woo!
