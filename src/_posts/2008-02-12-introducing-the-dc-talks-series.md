In [his post](http://jounce.net/2008/02/08/dc-design-talks-nearly-sold-out/), Jackson alludes to his negligence in posting about [DC Design Talks](http://www.dctalks.org/design) and how the event was nearly sold out. I’m willing to up the ante and make this post. As of this writing, DC Design Talks is **completely sold out**. I win at gross negligence.

DC Design Talks is the first of what we hope are many one-day, low-cost conferences for DC/Mid-Atlantic web folks by DC/Mid-Atlantic web folks. Should Design Talks go well (and we have no reason to believe it won’t), our goal is to put on three or four a year, each revolving around a theme (design, development, strategy, etc.). For each, we’ll gather some of the best local and regional talents in their discipline and arrange presentations on timely and relevant topics. Top it off with some great sponsorships from local businesses and you’ve got the makings of something special.

I’ll be the first to admit that I’m learning a lot about putting together a paid conference (first one I’ve ever done!), so please do bear with Jackson and I as we figure this whole thing out. We’ve been quite fortunate to have such an enthusiastic response from the community and our sponsors.

Expect plenty more to come. While you’re hanging out on the ol’ Internet, why not check out the [DC Design Talks](http://www.dctalks.org/design).
