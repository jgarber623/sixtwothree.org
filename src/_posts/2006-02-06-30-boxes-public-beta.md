[30 Boxes](http://www.30boxes.com/), a new web-based calendar app, just went public beta today. I read a post (canâ€™t remember where) about a week or so ago by someone who had seen a preview in action and it definitely sounds appealing. It mixes in regular online calendar functionality with all the bells and whistles of Web 2.0.

Should be interesting. [Check it out](http://www.30boxes.com/).
