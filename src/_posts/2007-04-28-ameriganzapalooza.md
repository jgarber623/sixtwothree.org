[Cindy](http://cindyli.com/) and I set off tomorrow morning (okay, actually _this_ morning, it’s really late) to drive ‘cross country from DC to San Francisco. Miss Li has moved out west and wants to get her car out there. I’ve always wanted to drive from coast to coast, so it works out. This afternoon I cobbled together a page for everyone to keep track of what we’re up to while we’re on the road.

It (should) be pulling in [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) photos, [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) tweets, and any blog posts written during the course of the trip. It’s not 100% complete, but hopefully I’ll have some time to finish a few things off during one of our stops. So check it out, and hope you enjoy keeping tabs on our (mis)adventures:
