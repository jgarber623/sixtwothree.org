[![Vongo: A failure of design](http://static.flickr.com/35/109952775_0da987bf1a_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/109952775/)

During the always excellent Colbert Report, I caught the tail end of an ad for Vongo. I wasn’t sure what Vongo was, so I went to their site to check it out. I was greeted with the above. The site reports an “OS Failure.”

This is horrible design for two reasons.

1. It is insulting to the user to insinuate a failure on their part due entirely to a failure of your site/application.
2. My first (and now, only) impression of this site is that it is unprofessional and poorly designed. I won’t be investigating their services any further.

Don’t let the Web 2.0 design style fool you. This sort of approach is decidedly Web 1.0. A humorous aside to you developers out there, check out the source.
