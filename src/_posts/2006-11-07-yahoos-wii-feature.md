Yahoo! has a feature/mini-site devoted to the [Nintendo Wii](http://wii.nintendo.com/). It’s fantastic for two reasons:

1. It’s about the Wii.
2. Yahoo! makes very good use of some of their properties (Flickr, del.icio.us, Yahoo! Answers, etc.)

I’m not sure if there’s any official cross-promotion between the two companies, but I’ll most certainly be spending some time on this one later. [Check it out](http://wii.yahoo.com/) for yourself.

Thanks to [Mr. Blogjangles](http://www.blogjangles.com/) for passing this one on.
