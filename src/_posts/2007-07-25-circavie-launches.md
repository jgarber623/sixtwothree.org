[CircaVie](http://www.circavie.com/) was one of the projects I worked on at AOL after [Ficlets](http://ficlets.com/) launched. CircaVie allows you to create visual timelines of events: your life, a vacation, etc. etc.

It’s a really cool concept and the design is fantastic. The core team included Dave McVicar, Corey Lucier, Jayna Wallace, Jenna Marino, Ari Kushimoto, and Kelly Gifford with support from Dan Bradley and others. Congrats to everyone involved, it’s starting to get some [pretty good press](http://mashable.com/2007/07/25/circavie/).

For the more technically inclined, there are some [microformats](http://microformats.org/) sprinkled about ([hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) mostly) and also support for [OpenID](http://openid.net/). Sweet!
