[Tavis](http://www.tavistucker.com/) found this yesterday while digging through some bookmarks and came across [PJ Hyett’s site](http://pjhyett.com/). What I found most interesting was [this post](http://pjhyett.com/articles/2006/04/18/im-still-here), particularly the photo. I took it! How cool is that?

I heard PJ speak on [How to Make the Most of Maps](http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060021) at this past year’s [SXSWi](http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/). PJ’s an extremely bright young guy who, at the time of the conference, had _just finished_ (literally) his college studies. Not too shabby, hopefully in a year or two (or three… or four…) I’ll be able to share the stage with some of my extremely talented contemporaries postulating and pontificating and all that on subjects heretofore unknown.

In other news, I turned 25 today. I had trouble getting out of bed, my joints ached, and I really, _really_ wanted to watch Matlock.
