It is with a great deal of excitement (and a small dose of nerves) that I bring to you the following news.

After three years working with my [current company](http://www.esitemarketing.com/) (forgive the website, we’re too busy building amazing sites), I’ve accepted a position as Associate Software Engineer with AOL. I’ll be working with [Kevin Lawver](http://lawver.net/) and others on the [AIM Pages](http://www.aimpages.com/) team. Many thanks to [Miss Cindy Li](http://cindyli.com/) for her help in getting my foot in the door.

I’d also like to thank everyone that I’ve worked with in the last three years. I’ve met a lot of wonderful people and have made some life-long friends. I’ll miss seeing you guys and girls, but I’d like to think the situation is analogous to us having to attend different middle schools after graduating elementary.
