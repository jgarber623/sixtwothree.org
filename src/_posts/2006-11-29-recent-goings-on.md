So here’s an abbreviated list of things that have been going on lately:

- Went down south to the [Refresh ’06 conference](http://refresh06.com/) with [Cindy](http://www.cindyli.com/) and [Jeremy](http://www.carbauja.com/). We ran into a few friends and made a lot of new ones. The conference was educational and sparked a few ideas. The post-conference socializing (“networking” if you want to be a nerd about it) was excellent, I had the occasion to meet a lot of really cool people. [SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com/) is about four months away, but it seems like a long time to not see folks.
- [AIM Pages](http://www.aimpages.com/) launched. I started on this project way into its development cycle and was responsible for developing several of the interfaces (Quick Edit Mode, Buddy Invites, and Pictures). AIM Pages is a really cool use of a number of technologies and I have high hopes for the products future development.
- Got addicted to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) whilst in Orlando. Everyone admits the site is a useless time-wasting vortex. And yet, we can’t turn away.
- [Jeremy Keith](http://www.adactio.com/) hits upon an interesting concept he’s dubbed [portable social networks](http://adactio.com/journal/1212/). Carbomb and I are working on an interface for this idea that we’re both pretty excited about.
- Several of us are putting together a recap of the Refresh ’06 conference for this month’s [Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) meeting. More info can be found on the site or on [the event’s upcoming.org page](http://upcoming.org/event/126801/).
- [Mir](http://www.mir-rock.com/) (this band I’m in, you see) holed up in the studio this weekend to record. Twenty six hours later, we have drums/bass on seven songs and guitars on four of those. We’re looking to do vocals this coming weekend. It’s terribly exciting to hear.

So this is a little scatter-brained, but it is getting late.
