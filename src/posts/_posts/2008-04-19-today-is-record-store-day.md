With the rise of online retailers and big box stores (Best Buy, etc.) and the general decline in hard copy sales of music, independent record stores have been shutting down at an alarming rate. Indie record stores, in addition to providing local and off-the-beaten-path music, are typically vibrant mini-communities within their larger, physical community.

So get out there and support your local indie record store today, Saturday, April 19, 2008! For more information, visit the [Record Store Day](//www.recordstoreday.com/) site.
