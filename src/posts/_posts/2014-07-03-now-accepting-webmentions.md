title: Now accepting webmentions!
---

As mentioned [previously](/blog/sending-webmentions-with-craft), I've spent much of the last year diving into the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/): learning as much as I can, following the latest developments, and building tools that will allow me to more easily publish on my own site. It's been a slow, incremental process but today I'm excited to launch the first version of [webmention.sixtwothree.org](http://webmention.sixtwothree.org).

That's right, this site now accepts webmentions! It's a really basic implementation: a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app backed by a SQLite database that accepts [properly-formatted webmentions](http://webmention.org/). Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. For now, webmentions are stored and occasionally manually verified. There's a small API that provides JSON-formatted webmentions for a given target URL. Along with a number of other enhancements and additions to better comply with the spec, I plan to use the API to display webmentions on posts here. I'll also open source the whole thing as soon as possible.

That's going to involve a little bit of JavaScript (and [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)) as this site is a collection of static files generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). No big deal, really. The critical content—the post—exists in the page's markup. Displaying webmentions on this site is, I believe, an enhancement and should they not display for any reason, so be it.

(Incidentally, [webmention.js](https://github.com/bcomnes/webmention.js) came out of [this past weekend's IndieWebCamp](http://indiewebcamp.com/2014) and is a nice collection of code to do exactly what I'll be doing here.)

As with my earlier Craft Webmention plugin, the webmention service I'm running here was developed and inspired by [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com/)'s [webmention.io project](http://webmention.io/). The source for that is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io). I wouldn't have been able to get the first pass of the service out the door either without [Tony](http://tpitale.com/)'s patient mentoring. Thanks, buddy!

It's a pretty amazing time to be publishing content on your own site. There are a ton of great people working on tools to help themselves and others regain control of our content while retaining the social benefits of the various silos.
