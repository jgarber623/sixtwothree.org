title: It’s A Crazy Mixxed Up Web
---

A lifetime ago, I worked for social news startup [Mixx](http://mixx.com/). If you follow that link, you'll notice the website no longer exists; such is the startup life. Like all good startups, Mixx had a [blog](http://blog.mixx.com/), a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mixx), and various other social presences scattered around the Web.

I really enjoyed my time at Mixx. I was able to work with some of my favorite people—most of us former AOLers—building a scrappy little upstart link-sharing service. The product had a devoted, niche audience but never really set the world on fire or upended any of the [major](http://digg.com/) [players](http://www.reddit.com/) in that space. That's okay, though; we had a great time building the service and learned a lot along the way. I'm grateful for my experience at Mixx and would jump at the chance to work with that crew again.

Mixx and the whole of its user-generated content eventually faded from the Web, its existence marked only by a brief [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixx) and a domain name—now owned by incubator [Idealab](http://www.idealab.com/)—that mirrors the [PopUrls](http://popurls.com/) website.

I recalled recently that, while at Mixx, I wrote a handful of posts for the aforementioned blog. Knowing full well that they were no longer available at their original URLs, I headed straight over to the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), dropped in [my old author page URL](http://blog.mixx.com/author/jason/), and started clicking around.

Thanks to the efforts of the Internet Archive, I was able to uncover the following posts:

- [Mixx for the iPhone](https://web.archive.org/web/20100419130228/http://blog.mixx.com/2008/01/23/mixx-for-the-iphone/)
- [Mixx at South by Southwest](https://web.archive.org/web/20100419164257/http://blog.mixx.com/2008/03/04/mixx-at-south-by-southwest)
- [What's your favorite favorite?](https://web.archive.org/web/20100131071144/http://blog.mixx.com/2008/04/15/whats-your-favorite-favorite/)
- [Mixx Picks in your Inbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20100418161803/http://blog.mixx.com/2008/05/08/mixx-picks-in-your-inbox/)
- [A Year in the Mixx!](https://web.archive.org/web/20100702095158/http://blog.mixx.com/2008/06/03/a-year-in-the-mixx/)
- [Mixx for the iPhone gets an update](https://web.archive.org/web/20100420064449/http://blog.mixx.com/2008/06/13/mixx-for-the-iphone-gets-an-update/)
- [Mixx and Greasemonkey](https://web.archive.org/web/20110314121757/http://blog.mixx.com/2009/02/16/mixx-and-greasemonkey/)

It's hard to know whether or not that's a complete list of the posts I wrote while at Mixx, but I'm glad that the Internet Archive was able to capture at least some of them. I've [written before](/posts/the-internet-never-forgets) about the relatively short memory of the Web so I won't rehash those points here. I'll instead again encourage you to [donate to the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/) and support their efforts to preserve our shared digital culture.
