title: End-Of-Year Reading Report (2015 Edition)
---

I set out this year to spend more time reading _actual books_ and, looking back, I'd say I fulfilled that particular resolution! [By the end of July](/posts/year-to-date-reading-report-mid-2015-edition), I'd cranked through eighteen books including several graphic novels, a handful of non-fiction, and a couple of books about the atom bomb.

I was able to keep up the pace in the second half of the year mixing in a heavy helping of graphic novels (working through that [comiXology](https://www.comixology.com/) collection), a handful of fiction, some design books, and a pair of motivational books by social worker and public speaker [Brené Brown](http://brenebrown.com/).

Here's the complete rundown of what I read in the second half of this year:
