Ten years ago today, at 10:03 pm EST, I launched the most-recent version of this site with [a mandatory introductory post](/posts/mandatory-introductory-post). _Ten years._

Quite a lot's changed since then. This site is now hosted with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and I long ago abandoned [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) in favor of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I've been hard at work for far too long on an [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/)-friendly CMS, dubbed [FrancisCMS](https://github.com/jgarber623/FrancisCMS), that I hope to launch over the upcoming holidays.

Some things haven't changed, though. I'm still very much a Web developer. I live and work in Washington, DC, and I play in [a post-rock band](https://whoistheorchid.com/) with some friends of mine. I also still enjoy taking [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jgarber/).

Those remain the basics for the time being. As I've tried to do over the last ten years, I'll continue to use this space to post things I find interesting and explain to you why I find them interesting. I've no idea what the Web (or this small site) will look like in ten years, but I'm excited to help shape it.
