Two of the founding members of [JPG Magazine](http://jpgmag.com/), [Derek Powazek](http://powazek.com/) and [Heather Champ](http://www.hchamp.com/) have left [8020 Publishing](http://www.8020publishing.com/) over what appears to be an attempt at revisionism on the part of JPG’s “CEO.” It’s a sad story and I can’t imagine how hard it is for Derek and Heather to walk away from the community they grew. I’ll leave the “right” or the “wrong” up to you, dear reader:

- Derek’s [The Real Story of JPG Magazine](http://powazek.com/posts/534)
- Heather’s [blog post](http://www.hchamp.com/other/archives/001173.html)

There’s been a [pretty strong reaction on Flickr](http://flickr.com/groups/ideletedmyjpgaccount/) and I’ll soon be adding myself to the list after I get my refund for my subscription. Upsetting that I had _just_ subscribed to the magazine and was really looking forward to it.

You can still find the pre-revisionist issues of JPG Magazine on [LuLu](http://www.lulu.com/jpgmag).

**Update (16 May 2007):** There’s been a [lengthy discussion](http://flickr.com/groups/jpgmag/discuss/72157600219677218/) of the matter on Flickr, including comments from JPG Magazine. Part of me feels a bit knee-jerk reactionary on this, but the issues involved are complicated: mixing business/personal relationships, maintaining transparency, etc. etc. We web folk are a passionate (oft reactionary) bunch, which makes dealing with situations like this that much more difficult.
