**Update (11/10/2006):** activateActiveX() version 1.2 is available [here](http://sixtwothree.org/blog/archives/2006/11/10/activateactivex-12/).

[Tavis](http://www.tavistucker.com/) (no website right now… lame…) helped me out and made a few updates to [activateActiveX()](http://sixtwothree.org/blog/archives/2006/05/07/activateactivex-a-standards-based-solution-to-internet-explorers-active-content-woes/). In my previous post, I completely neglected giving him any credit for helping me out with version 1.0.

What’s new in version 1.1? Tavis has optimized some of the loops and done a better job documenting the script than I could have. Thanks bud!
