Just a quick note before I’m off to bed, [Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) launched today. Briefly, it’s an organization for professionals in the web development/new media industry. Everyone I’ve talked to seems really in to it, which is certainly exciting.

I’ll write more later (soon?) about the process of getting the site going and some of the new(ish) tools I’m using to keep track of things. Cheers.
