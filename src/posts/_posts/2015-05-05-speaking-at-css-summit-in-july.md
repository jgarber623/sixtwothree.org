title: Speaking at CSS Summit in July
---

This July 7th, I'll be speaking at the seventh annual [CSS Summit](http://csssummit.com/), a three-day online conference organized by the wonderful people at [Environments for Humans](http://environmentsforhumans.com/), alongside some incredible Web designers and developers. Look at that lineup!

It's been ages since I've spoken publicly and I'm grateful to [Christopher](http://christopherschmitt.com/) for inviting me to kick things off. No pressure! The plan's to present a brief history of [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement), examine its relevance in 2015, and offer a framework for applying the principles of progressive enhancement to the entire design process.

My hope is that attendees will walk away with a better conceptual understanding of progressive enhancement and practical ways in which they can apply that understanding to their design and development process. It's an amazing time for Web designers and I'm looking forward to sharing with the CSS Summit crowd the lessons I've learned designing and building [future-friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/) Web things.
