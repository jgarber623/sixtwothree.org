title: What I’ve been up to lately

Wow, so it’s been awhile. I apologize for that, it’s been a tad hectic around here lately. A few things I’ve been up to:

- Went down to Atlanta, GA for my buddy Ryan’s wedding. I was honored to be one of Ryan’s groomsmen and I wish him and Nikki well in their new life together. It was a good time and I met some great people whilst down South. [In-progress Flickr set](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/sets/72157594234656541/).
- [Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) is going gangbusters. We’ve got a great meeting set up for tomorrow night on [Microformats](http://microformats.org). I’m looking forward to this one. It’ll be the first presentation I’m not actively participating in, so I get to sit back and soak up the knowledge.
- [Cindy Li](http://www.cindyli.com/) invited me along to dinner with her, [Porter](http://www.g9g.org/) and [his wife Laura](http://wonderwhy.blogspot.com/), and none other than [Eric Meyer](http://www.meyerweb.com/). Yes, _the_ Eric Meyer. Good food and good company. It was an honor and a privilege to be ribbed by the man who [wrote the book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596005253/?tag=sixtwothree-20) on CSS. &lt;/namedropping&gt;

There’s one or two other major items that I can’t mention quite yet. Big news coming soon. Sit tight, folks.
