So far the response for [Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) has been astounding. I’m totally addicted to my [Minty fresh](http://www.haveamint.com/) stats. Among others who are blogging the site, [Garrett Dimon](http://www.garrettdimon.com/) spoke to the rapidly increasing number of Refresh-ing cities in a [post earlier today](http://www.garrettdimon.com/archives/refresh-your-city). Needless to say, shortly thereafter, traffic to Refresh DC picked up mightily.

[What is groupr](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/92908306/), you ask? You’ll know right soon. Right soon, indeed.
