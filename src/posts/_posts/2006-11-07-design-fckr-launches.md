Alex Giron (he of [CSS Beauty](http://www.cssbeauty.com/)) just launched a new site, [design fckr](http://dfckr.com/). From the site:

> DFCKR is a publication created with the intention of keeping track of design related news and resources. The site is maintained by a team of web designers/developers with a passion for design.

The site is very well-designed and I look forward to the content Alex and crew provide!
