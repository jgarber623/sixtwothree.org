title: Refresh DC gets some Microformat lovin’
---

After [Jackson Wilkinson’s](http://www.jackwilkinson.com/) blazing [presentation](http://jounce.net/presentations/refreshMicroformats/) last month, one would think I would’ve done this much sooner, but alas, it was not to be. Until now. The Refresh DC site gets a jolt of [Microformat](http://www.microformats.org/)-y goodness in the form of an [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) event.

I think I did everything correctly. The [Technorati parser](http://technorati.com/events/http://refresh-dc.org/) and/or iCal isn’t taking the date format very well and I’m not sure if it’s me, the parser, or the calendar program. Dear reader, your thoughts? [Check my work](http://refresh-dc.org/).
