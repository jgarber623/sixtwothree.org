Superfriend Cindy Li just launched a CSS-ified redesign of [her personal site](http://www.cindyli.com/) today before jaunting off across the Atlantic to attend [@media](http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/). My congratulations go out to her for slugging her way through CSS for the first time. She’s done a marvelous job and her site is definitely worth checking out.

I secretly hope she picks me up one of [Jon Hicks’](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/) [fancy new business cards](http://flickr.com/photos/hicksdesign/163538201/) while she’s in England!
