It’s been a while since my last post. Please pardon our dust. A lot’s been going on, so here’s a brief wrap-up.

[Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) was featured this week on two CSS gallery sites: [Most Inspired](http://www.mostinspired.com/) and [CSS Mania](http://cssmania.com/galleries/2007/03/07/refreshdc.php). As far as I know, none of my work has ever been featured on a gallery site, so this is particularly cool. Big thanks again to [Martin](http://www.marylandmedia.com/) for the fantastic design.

Speaking of Martin, he’s joined forces with [Alex Giron](http://www.cssbeauty.com/) and [John Riviello](http://www.johnriviello.com/) to form [nclud](http://nclud.com/). I’m really looking forward to seeing what those three put out as they’re all extremely talented (and all-around good guys, too!). Best of luck, gents!

In recent months, [200ok](http://200ok.net/) has gone from being a quirky name that [Jeremy](http://www.carbauja.com/) and I used for [silly](http://groupr.200ok.net/) [projects](http://contactr.200ok.net/) to a full-fledged company. We filled out all the paperwork and hooked up with the amazingly talented Justin Babuscio, [Cindy Li](http://cindyli.com/), and [Nguyet Vuong](http://www.newwaydesign.com/). Never fear, none of us are quitting our day jobs yet, we’re just trying our hand at small business ownership. Working two (and sometimes three or four) jobs at a time has been taxing, but we’re all excited about where this might take us.

[South by Southwest](http://2007.sxsw.com/) is coming up right soon. I fly out tomorrow morning bright and early with [Mr. Lawver](http://lawver.net/) and a whole litany of other AOL folk. This will be my third trip to Austin for the conference and, once again, it’s going to be amazing. The crowd this year is going to be larger than ever (by all accounts), so I’m interested to see how that goes. There are more events and panels that I’m interested in than I have time to list here, so go [check it out](http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/) for yourself.

Odds are I’ll have another big announcement (hopefully) later today regarding a project I’ve been working on. Some of you may know it as Ape Shirt, but right soon you’ll know it by it’s real name. Stay tuned…
