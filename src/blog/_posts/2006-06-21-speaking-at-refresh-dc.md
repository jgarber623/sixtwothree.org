title: Speaking at Refresh DC
---

My partner in crime, [Jeremy Carbaugh](http://www.carbauja.com/), and I will be speaking next Thursday night at the June meeting of [Refresh DC](http://refresh-dc.org/). We’ll be discussing APIs: what they are, why they’re cool, and why your next web app should have one.

If you’re a web designer, developer, or otherwise a web professional in the Washington, DC, area, come check out the meeting next Thursday night. More information about the meeting and Refresh DC in general can be found over on [the Refresh DC website](http://refresh-dc.org/).
