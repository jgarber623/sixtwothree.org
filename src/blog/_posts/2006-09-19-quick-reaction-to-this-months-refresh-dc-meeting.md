title: Quick reaction to this month’s Refresh DC meeting
---

One word: wow. Just, wow. I’ll post more about the meeting here and on [the Refresh site](http://refresh-dc.org/) once I get a few hours of sleep. But that’s my first reaction to this month’s gathering. Great turnout, great topic and presentation, and great company and conversation afterwards. My hat’s off to [The Motley Fool](http://www.fool.com/) crew for hosting.

That’s it for now, expect a better recap tomorrow!
