[Jeremy](http://www.carbauja.com/) just pointed me to this post on [SkypeDriving](http://share.skype.com/sites/skypegear/2007/05/skypedriving_contest_over_at_s.html). Did [Cindy](http://www.cindyli.com/) and I inadvertently invent something?

Our setup in the photo was Cindy’s MacBook Pro using the built-in iSight, Skype, and [Kevin’s](http://lawver.net/) Verizon EVDO card. Oh yeah, and a VW Beetle cruising along in the neighborhood of 90mph.
