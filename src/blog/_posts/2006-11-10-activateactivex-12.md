Small update here, just did some loop optimization using an inverse `while` loop. Thanks to [Steve Chipman](http://www.slayeroffice.com/) for that insight.

For the next version (who knows what it’ll be numbered… v2 maybe?), I’d like to take a look at [Robert’s suggestions/comments/recommendations](http://sixtwothree.org/blog/archives/2006/05/20/activateactivex-11/#comment-734).

[Download activateActiveX-1.2.js now](/files/activateActiveX-1.2.js).
