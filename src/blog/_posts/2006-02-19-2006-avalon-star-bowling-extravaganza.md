title: 2006 Avalonstar Bowling Extravaganza

At SXSWi this year, [Avalonstar](http://www.avalonstar.com/) is hosting a Bowling Extravaganza at The Union Underground on Monday night, March 13. Spots (if they’re still available) are limited, so head on over and sign up if you’re interested.

If bowling’s not your thing (and cheerleading is), come on out and root for Team Refresh (the team I’m on) or Team Refresh II. We’ve got Team KuraFire in the first round. Time to catch up on my bowling by watching The Big Lebowski…
