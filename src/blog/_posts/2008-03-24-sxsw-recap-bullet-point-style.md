- Dang there were a lot of people.
- Wait in lines? No thanks, start your own party at Buffalo Billiards.
- [The panel](http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060356) went really well. We had a great time and I think the audience enjoyed it as well. Keep an eye on the [podcasts page](http://2008.sxsw.com/coverage/podcasts/). We’ll be up there eventually.
- SXSW will never get my badge photo correct. Ever.
- I’ve never drank so much in all my life. Well, if you know me, you know that’s really not saying a whole lot.
- [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) is the way to get things done.
- [Ficlets](http://www.ficlets.com/) won [a major award](http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/winners/)! Check out [Kevin’s photo](http://flickr.com/photos/kplawver/2349178183/) of the trophy.
- Team Refresh crushed all comers (again) in the 3rd Annual Bowling Tournament. One word: **dynasty**. See [Dan’s photo of us all](http://flickr.com/photos/dandrinkard/2330982353/).
- The Zuckerberg/Lacey incident was the best and worst panel/keynote I attended.
- While a lot of presentations were lacking on the nitty gritty, most everything I sat in on sparked at least one idea, related or otherwise.
