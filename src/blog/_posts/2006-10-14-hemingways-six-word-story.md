title: Hemingway’s six word story
---

[Caterina Fake](http://www.caterina.net/) posted this last month (and I’m now just catching up with it via [this post](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/sunspots_the_bubble_dome_edition.php) on [SvN](http://37signals.com/svn/)):

> Ernest Hemingway was once prodded to compose a complete story in six words. His answer, personally felt to be his best prose ever, was “For sale: baby shoes, never used.”

That, to me, is the most beautiful and sad thing I’ve ever read. Time to re-read “The Old Man and the Sea.”
