title: My Year in Cities, 2007
---

Since [Mr. Haney](http://patrickhaney.com/thinktank/2007/12/30/my-year-in-cities-2007) is doing it, and anything he does is worth doing right, I present to you the cities I traveled to and through in 2007.

- Washington, DC (I live here-ish)
- Somewhere up in Maryland (for Mir’s one-and-only show)
- Austin, TX ([South by Southwest](http://www.sxsw.com/))
- Nashville, TN ([Ameriganzapalooza](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/sets/72157600158273499/))
- Graceland, Memphis, TN (Ameriganzapalooza)
- Oklahoma City, OK (Ameriganzapalooza)
- Albuquerque, NM (Ameriganzapalooza)
- Grand Canyon, AZ (Ameriganzapalooza)
- Boulder City, NV (Ameriganzapalooza)
- Las Vegas, NV (Ameriganzapalooza)
- San Francisco, CA (Ameriganzapalooza)
- New York City, NY ([Future of Web Design](http://www.futureofwebdesign.com/))
- Harrisonburg, VA (spoke to Grover’s web design class with [Jeremy](http://www.carbauja.com/))
- Richmond, VA (my family lives there)

Looking back, it’s been a helluva year. I finally got to make that cross-country drive I’ve wanted to do since I read “On The Road” in high school (thanks [Cindy](http://www.cindyli.com/)!). I <em>finally</em> visited New York City (cool town, looking forward to going back). I’m indebted to all my friends and family near and far who’ve helped me out along the way. You guys are the best.

See you in ’08!
