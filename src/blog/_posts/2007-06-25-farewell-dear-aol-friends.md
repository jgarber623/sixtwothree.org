excerpt: This past Friday was my last day with AOL.
title: Farewell, dear AOL friends
---

This past Friday was my last day with AOL. About a month ago I was given an opportunity to join a startup with a couple former (now current) colleagues and, after some very critical examination, decided to make the jump. My stay at AOL was brief, but I learned a lot and made a lot of great friends. There were highs and lows along the way, but on the whole, I enjoyed the experience and look forward to possibly returning down the line.

I’m proud of the work I did at AOL. [Ficlets](http://ficlets.com/) is the best project I’ve ever worked on, hands down. Without coming off as sappy, I’d also like to thank [Kevin](http://lawver.net/) for being a mentor (you were my first — ha!) and letting me tag along.

In the coming weeks and months I’ll be able to give more info on what exactly I’m doing, so stay tuned.

I also [bought a car](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/tags/mazda3/) recently!
