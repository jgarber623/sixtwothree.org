So after having this site with [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/) for almost a year now, I finally got around to “finishing” the design for this blog. As you can see, it’s not a whole lot, but it’s my first attempt at using [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/).

Anyway, I’m a web developer (as you might have imagined by the [front page](/). I live in the Washington, DC, metro area and work in Bethesda, Maryland. I play in an [indie rock band](http://www.mir-rock.com/) with [some](http://www.carbaja.com/) [friends](http://lamarocket.blogspot.com/) of [mine](http://fistagon7.blogspot.com/). I enjoy taking [photos](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/).

Those are the basics for the time being, I’m sure you’ll figure out the rest along the way. I’m going to attempt to use this space to post things I find interesting with a little bit of explanation as to why I find them interesting. “Contributing to the intelligent discourse” is what they call it.
