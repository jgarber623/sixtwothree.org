There’s a [good amount of conversation](http://technorati.com/posts/tag/barcampdc) going on post-[BarCamp DC](http://barcampdc.org/). There’s a growing amount of talk about community:

Martin hits the nail on the head. Late into the evening of BarCamp, there were still conversations going on about community. [Alex Giron](http://www.cssbeauty.com/) and [Doug March](http://www.doug-march.com/) came up with several great ideas for community-building. Expect good things out of those two.

[Samantha Warren](http://blog.ogilvypr.com/?p=233), on the Ogilvy PR blog, and Alisa Schadt and Jenna Marino, on the [AIM Product Design Group blog](http://design.aim.com/?p=318) also have excellent perspectives on the event.

Also worthy of note is [Ross Karchner’s](http://rossnotes.com/) [DC Tech Events Weekly](http://www.dctechevents.com/). Ross provides a week-by-week rundown of all tech-related events happening in and around Washington, DC. Glancing at the list, you’ll see there are a ton of groups out there. Go find one that suits your passion.
