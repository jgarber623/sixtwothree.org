excerpt: A recent interview with a candidate got me thinking about values.
tags: design principles
title: What do you value?
---

In a recent interview, I asked a candidate what she, as a front-end developer, values. Without hesitation, she answered, "Accessibility." As she explained her answer, it became apparent she didn't mean accessibility in the _technical_ sense. She viewed accessibility holistically: accessible content, accessible design, and accessible implementation.

What a wonderful answer! Her experience of the Web through her personal use and through observation of others led her to value accessibility above all else. Her response made no mention of particular technologies or tools. Instead, she emphasized the importance of accessibility as a pervasive value in her work.

The conversation served as a reminder that we should all take time to reflect on the values that influence our work.
