[Kevin](http://lawver.net/archive/2006/12/26/h09_five_things_you_may_not_know_about_kevin.php) tagged [Cindy](http://www.cindyli.com/index.php/site/comments/five_things_you_may_not_know_about_cindy/) and I with this and I’m just now getting around to doing mine (figures). So, here it goes, five things you may not know about me.

- I’m a huge fan of (the art of) professional wrestling. I could try to explain why, but odds are you won’t understand. No offense intended, that’s just the way it is. Moving on…
- I have a dreadful fear of snakes. Ever since I was young, I’ve hated snakes of all kinds. Maybe I inherited it from my grandfather.
- I’m a HUGE [Transformers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_series) nerd. I could probably recite the entire [movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie) from memory if required. As such, I’m terribly depressed about the outlook of the new live-action movie.
- My dream car is a [DeLorean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Lorean_DMC-12). Yep, the car from [Back to the Future](http://www.bttf.com/).
- I’m a workaholic. It started senior year at [JMU](http://www.jmu.edu/) and hasn’t really settled down yet. I’m not even entirely sure what I’m working toward. I just like what I do and I spend an inordinate amount of time gettin’ good at it.

So there you have it, five things you may not have known about me.
