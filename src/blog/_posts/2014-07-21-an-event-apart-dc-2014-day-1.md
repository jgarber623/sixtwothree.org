title: An Event Apart DC 2014, Day 1
---

For the fourth year running I'm attending [An Event Apart DC](http://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2014), the design conference for people who make websites. And, like the past two years, I'm [taking notes](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/).

Here are all of my notes and links from day one of the conference:

- [Understanding Web Design](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/aneventapartdc/understanding-web-design/), presented by [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/).
- [The Integral Designer: Developing You](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/aneventapartdc/the-integral-designer-developing-you/), presented by [Whitney Hess](http://whitneyhess.com/).
- [Putting the Fonts into Webfonts](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/aneventapartdc/putting-the-fonts-into-webfonts/), presented by [Jonathan Hoefler](http://www.typography.com/).
- [Screen Time](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/aneventapartdc/screen-time/), presented by [Luke Wroblewski](http://lukew.com/).
- [Mind the Gap: Designing in the Space Between Devices](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/aneventapartdc/mind-the-gap-designing-in-the-space-between-devices/), presented by [Josh Clark](http://globalmoxie.com/).
- [UX Strategy Means Business](http://sketchnotes.sixtwothree.org/aneventapartdc/ux-strategy-means-business/), presented by [Jared Spool](http://www.uie.com/).

It's a little early yet to write about the conference's primary themes ([as I've done before](/blog/reflections-on-an-event-apart-dc-2013)) as we've only just wrapped Day 1. There's still Day 2 and the accessibility workshop on Wednesday.

So far, the conference has been great and I'm excited for the remaining two days.
