excerpt: Itâ€™s feed migrating season.
title: Update your feed URLs
---

I'll be shutting off the old [Feedburner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedburner) feed URL for this site on June 1st, 2014. If you're currently subscribed using `http://feeds.feedburner.com/sixtwothree`, please update your feed reader to use either of the two feed URLs below:

- [http://sixtwothree.org/blog/atom](/blog/atom)
- [http://sixtwothree.org/blog/rss](/blog/rss)

These new feed URLs are just for posts. I'll be working to add additional feeds for other content types in the coming months.

As always, thanks for reading!
