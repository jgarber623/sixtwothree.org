title: Update to the presentations
---

[Nguyet](http://www.livejournal.com/users/nofcna/) pointed out earlier today that the incrementing on my [S5](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/)-based presentations was a bit annoying. Soooo… I’ve updated them, sans incrementing. Check them out:

- [Meaningful (X)HTML](http://sixtwothree.org/presentations/meaningful-xhtml/)
- [CSS Building Blocks](http://sixtwothree.org/presentations/css-building-blocks/)
