A whole bunch of the DC crew is heading up to New York City for the [Future of Web Design](http://www.futureofwebdesign.com/) conference next week. [Mixx](http://www.mixx.com/) is representing in a big way with myself and [Alex](http://www.cssbeauty.com/) in attendance. We’ll also be handing out the shiny new Mixx buttons seen above!

This will be my first time in the Big Apple (as preposterous as that sounds). Other than the conference (of course), I intend to hit up some record stores, see a show or two, and maybe go to Letterman. We’ll see what happens. Either way, it’s going to be a blast.
