The good gentlemen at [nclud](http://www.nclud.com/) are putting together an [“After After Party”](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/241371/) next Thursday evening, August 30th at [Old Dominion Brewhouse](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1219+9th+St+NW,+Washington,+DC+20001,+USA&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1) in downtown DC. Martin posted all the details over on the [nclud Sketchbook](http://www.nclud.com/sketchbook/dc-happy-hour-introducing-ncluds-after-after-party).

This should be a ton of fun and will go a long way to building community. Not every event has to be lectures, after all. I hope to see everyone out and having a good time next week!
