In [The Worst President In History?](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9961300/the_worst_president_in_history?rnd=1145577215127&has-player=unknown), Rolling Stone’s Sean Wilentz reports the following:

> According to the Treasury Department, the forty-two presidents who held office between 1789 and 2000 borrowed a combined total of $1.01 trillion from foreign governments and financial institutions. But between 2001 and 2005 alone, the Bush White House borrowed $1.05 trillion, more than all of the previous presidencies combined.

I’ll try to avoid dragging politics into this site, but this was worth mentioning. I’ve read some amazingly awful figures about the Bush Presidency, but this one was new to me. Unbelievable.
