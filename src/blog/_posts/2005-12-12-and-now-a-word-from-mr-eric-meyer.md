[AIGA](http://www.aiga.org/) has been posting a [series of podcasts](http://feeds.feedburner.com/aigapodcastdirectory) with the speakers for [An Event Apart](http://www.aneventapart.com/).

In [Talking with Eric Meyer: An Event Apart #02](http://feeds.feedburner.com/aigapodcastdirectory?m=1), Eric is asked why designers should have to worry about code.

> “You should have to worry about code for the same reason a print designer has to worry about ink and paper weight, or for the same reason a painter has to worry about paint and canvas and brush selection.”
