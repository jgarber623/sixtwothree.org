title: The Sound of Animals Fighting interview
---

A month or so back, [J-sin](http://flickr.com/photos/fistagon7/) asked me if I’d like to interview [The Sound of Animals Fighting](http://www.thesoundofanimalsfighting.com/). TSoAF is a progressive, experimental art project/rock band made up of members of Circa Survive, Finch, Rx Bandits, and a number of other great bands. They’ve put out two very different records and just wrapped up a series of shows (their only series, sadly) out west.

When J-sin asked me if I’d like to interview the band, I jumped at the opportunity. With [Nguyet’s](http://www.newwaydesign.com/) help, I put together what I thought was a pretty good series of questions. I sent them off to J-sin and hoped that I wouldn’t come off as a rank amateur (which I was/am).

Good news is, the interview has just been published on J-sin’s site, [Smother](http://www.smother.net/). J-sin gave me the thumbs up on it (thanks dude!) and it looks like the Nightingale enjoyed answering my questions.
