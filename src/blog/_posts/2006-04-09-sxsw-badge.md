Casually late, it’s a ridiculously brief wrap-up of this year’s trip to Austin for [SXSWi](http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/). The panels were good, but definitely different from last year. Travelling with more people was fun, but at times daunting. [The Driskill Hotel](http://www.driskillhotel.com/) is awesome. I met a ton of awesome people at the [bowling tournament](http://bowling.avalonstar.com/) where Team Refresh whooped up on everyone. Rock. [My Flickr set](http://flickr.com/photos/jgarber/sets/72057594079478628/) of the entire affair.

It’s 1 in the morning and that’s all I’ve got in me for the time being.
