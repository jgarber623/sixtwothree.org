excerpt: I’ll be speaking at South by Southwest.
title: Speaking at SXSW ’08
---

This is a slight bit of old news, but considering how long it’s been since I’ve written anything here, it’s still “news.”

I found out a few weeks back (on a boat coming back from the Statue of Liberty, no less) that my (our) panel for [South by Southwest](http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/) was selected. I’m pretty excited about this, it’ll be my first time speaking at a large-scale conference and I’m honored to share the stage with [Kevin](http://lawver.net/), [Cindy](http://www.cindyli.com/), [Thomas](http://vanderwal.net/), and [Leslie](http://www.morellc.com/).

So if you find yourself in Austin for SXSW, come out to our panel. More details once we know exactly when and where we’ll be speaking.
